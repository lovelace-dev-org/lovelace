ABOUT
=====

Lovelace is a learning environment created at the University of Oulu for programming and associated sciences. It was created to answer the need for programming education that scales up to large number of students with limited teaching resources. Its primary purpose is to offer tools for creating meaningful exercises that are automatically evaluated by the system. Embedding these exercises into material pages is the main mode of delivery for Lovelace courses as it creates an uninterrupted flow where students can get a confirmation of learning the previous topics before moving on to next ones.


INSTALLATION
============

The primary way of installing and upgrading Lovelace is to use the Ansible scripts maintained at
the [Lovelace Ansible repository][lovelace-ansible]. These scripts cover needs from development
installation to local testing to production installation across multiple servers. These scripts have
been written and tested for Ubuntu, and may need modification for other systems.
